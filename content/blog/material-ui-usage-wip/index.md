I'm currently working on [a teaching page](https://siowyisheng.github.io/mui-usage/) for the usage of Material UI, since I found the concept pretty tough to grok from the docs and I couldn't find good resources elsewhere, especially for Material UI v4.

I'm mostly done with the navigation and structure of the site. I'll just clean up article pages and add a ScrollToTopOnMount and complete the content. ☺️

Edit: This is currently discontinued.
